# Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing Visualization

This project visualizes data on doping in professional bicycle racing, specifically the 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez.  It uses D3.js to create an interactive scatterplot.

## Technologies Used

*   JavaScript
*   D3.js (v7)

## Data Source

The data is sourced from the freeCodeCamp Project API: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json`

## Features

*   Interactive scatterplot showing rider times against year.
*   Color-coded dots to indicate doping allegations.
*   Tooltips displaying rider details on hover (name, nationality, year, time, and doping allegations, if any).
*   Legend explaining the color coding.

## How to Run

1.  Save the HTML as `index.html`, the CSS as `styles.css`, and the JavaScript as `script.js` in the same directory.
